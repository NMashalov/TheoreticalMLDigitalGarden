target=\"_self\">Word2vec</a>: Word2vec is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) for obtaining vector representations of words. These vectors capture information about the meaning of the word and their usage in context. The word2vec algorithm estimates these representations by modeling text in a large corpus. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence. As the name implies, word2vec represents each distinct word with a particular list of numbers called a vector. The vectors are chosen carefully such that they capture the semantic and syntactic qualities of words; as such, a simple mathematical function (cosine similarity) can indicate the level of semantic similarity between the words represented by those vectors.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Word2vec","level":1,"id":"Word2vec"}],"backlinks":["knowledge/recent-results/generative-modeling/language-models/tools/text-embedding.html"],"links":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec","knowledge/recent-results/generative-modeling/language-models/notable-works/word2vec.html#Word2vec"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"knowledge/recent-results/generative-modeling/language-models/notable-works/word2vec.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","createdTime":1709386596365,"modifiedTime":1709386596365,"sourceSize":818,"sourcePath":"Knowledge/Recent

The Fokker-Planck equation has multiple applications in information theory, graph theory, data science, finance, economics etc.<br>\nIt is named after Adriaan Fokker and Max Planck, who described it in 1914 and 1917. It is also known as the Kolmogorov forward equation, after Andrey Kolmogorov, who independently discovered it in 1931. When applied to particle position distributions, it is better known as the Smoluchowski equation (after Marian Smoluchowski), and in this context it is equivalent to the convection–diffusion equation. When applied to particle position and momentum distributions, it is known as the Klein–Kramers equation. The case with zero diffusion is the continuity equation. The Fokker–Planck equation is obtained from the master equation through Kramers–Moyal expansion.The first consistent microscopic derivation of the Fokker–Planck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Nikolay Krylov.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Fokker–Planck equation","level":1,"id":"Fokker–Planck equation"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation","knowledge/well-known/math/differential-equations/fokker–planck-equation.html#Fokker–Planck equation"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"knowledge/well-known/math/differential-equations/fokker–planck-equation.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","createdTime":1709387910760,"modifiedTime":1709387910760,"sourceSize":1535,"sourcePath":"Knowledge/Well known/Math/Differential equations/Fokker–Planck equation.md","exportPath":"knowledge/well-known/math/differential-equations/fokker–planck-equation.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"knowledge/well-known/math/flows/flow.html":{"title":"Flow","icon":"","description":"<br>ELI5\nTransportation of matter\n<br>Wiki: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics)\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics)\" target=\"_self\">Flow</a>","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Flow","level":1,"id":"Flow"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics)","knowledge/well-known/math/flows/flow.html#Flow"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"knowledge/well-known/math/flows/flow.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","createdTime":1709398068389,"modifiedTime":1709398148781,"sourceSize":104,"sourcePath":"Knowledge/Well known/Math/Flows/Flow.md","exportPath":"knowledge/well-known/math/flows/flow.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html":{"title":"Fourier transform","icon":"","description":"<a class=\"tag\" href=\"?query=tag:fourier\" style=\"background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;\">#fourier</a> <a class=\"tag\" href=\"?query=tag:basis\" style=\"background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;\">#basis</a> <br> <a href=\"knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html\" class=\"tag\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">#fourier</a> <a href=\"knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html\" class=\"tag\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">#basis</a><br>\nWiki: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\" target=\"_self\">Fourier transform</a><br><a data-href=\"Duality\" href=\"knowledge/well-known/math/concepts/duality.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Duality</a>","aliases":[],"tags":["#fourier","#basis"],"headers":[{"heading":"Fourier transform","level":1,"id":"Fourier transform"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html","knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform","knowledge/well-known/math/concepts/duality.html","knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html#Fourier transform"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","createdTime":1709405941810,"modifiedTime":1709405989797,"sourceSize":106,"sourcePath":"Knowledge/Well known/Math/Functional analysis/Fourier transform.md","exportPath":"knowledge/well-known/math/functional-analysis/fourier-transform.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"knowledge/well-known/math/graphs/bipartite-graph.html":{"title":"Bipartite graph","icon":"","description":"<br><img alt=\"Bipartite graph Thumbnail\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Simple_bipartite_graph%3B_two_layers.svg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph\" target=\"_self\">Bipartite graph</a>: In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets and , that is, every edge connects a vertex in to one in .

Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.The two sets and may be thought of as a coloring of the graph with two colors: if one colors all nodes in blue, and all nodes in red, each edge has endpoints of differing colors, as is required in the graph coloring problem.

This particular method relies on event A occurring with some sort of relationship with another event B. In this situation, the event A can be analyzed by a conditional probability with respect to B. If the event of interest is A and the event B is known or assumed to have occurred, \"the conditional probability of A given B\", or \"the probability of A under the condition B\", is usually written as P(A|B) or occasionally PB(A). This can also be understood as the fraction of probability B that intersects with A, or the ratio of the probabilities of both events happening to the \"given\" one happening (how many times A occurs rather than not assuming B has occurred): .For example, the probability that any given person has a cough on any given day may be only 5%. But if we know or assume that the person is sick, then they are much more likely to be coughing. For example, the conditional probability that someone unwell (sick) is coughing might be 75%, in which case we would have that P(Cough) = 5% and P(Cough|Sick) = 75 %. Although there is a relationship between A and B in this example, such a relationship or dependence between A and B is not necessary, nor do they have to occur simultaneously.<br>\nP(A|B) may or may not be equal to P(A), i.e., the unconditional probability or absolute probability of A. If P(A|B) = P(A), then events A and B are said to be independent: in such a case, knowledge about either event does not alter the likelihood of each other. P(A|B) (the conditional probability of A given B) typically differs from P(B|A). For example, if a person has dengue fever, the person might have a 90% chance of being tested as positive for the disease. In this case, what is being measured is that if event B (having dengue) has occurred, the probability of A (tested as positive) given that B occurred is 90%, simply writing P(A|B) = 90%. Alternatively, if a person is tested as positive for dengue fever, they may have only a 15% chance of actually having this rare disease due to high false positive rates. In this case, the probability of the event B (having dengue) given that the event A (testing positive) has occurred is 15% or P(B|A) = 15%. It should be apparent now that falsely equating the two probabilities can lead to various errors of reasoning, which is commonly seen through base rate fallacies.<br>\nWhile conditional probabilities can provide extremely useful information, limited information is often supplied or at hand. Therefore, it can be useful to reverse or convert a conditional probability using Bayes' theorem: . Another option is to display conditional probabilities in a conditional probability table to illuminate the relationship between events.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Conditional probability","level":1,"id":"Conditional probability"}],"backlinks":["knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/autoregressive.html"],"links":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability","knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/conditional-probability.html#Conditional probability"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/conditional-probability.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","createdTime":1709390168523,"modifiedTime":1709390168523,"sourceSize":3199,"sourcePath":"Knowledge/Well known/Math/Probability Theory/Conditional probability.md","exportPath":"knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/conditional-probability.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/index.html":{"title":"Index","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Index","level":1,"id":"Index"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/index.html#Index"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/index.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","createdTime":1709389674028,"modifiedTime":1709389674028,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Knowledge/Well known/Math/Probability Theory/Index.md","exportPath":"knowledge/well-known/math/probability-theory/index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"knowledge/well-known/math/topology/embedding/intro.html":{"title":"Intro","icon":"","description":"<br>When some object is said to be embedded in another object , the embedding is given by some injective and structure-preserving map .
