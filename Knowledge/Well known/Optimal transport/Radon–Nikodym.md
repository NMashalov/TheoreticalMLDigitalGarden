[Radon–Nikodym theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon%E2%80%93Nikodym_theorem) 

In mathematics, the Radon–Nikodym theorem is a result in measure theory that expresses the relationship between two measures defined on the same measurable space.


> [!NOTE] Note 
> The Radon–Nikodym theorem essentially states that, under certain conditions, any measure ν can be expressed in this way with respect to another measure μ on the same space. The function  f  is then called the Radon–Nikodym derivative and is denoted by ${\tfrac {d\nu }{d\mu }}$ . 


One way to derive a new measure from one already given is to assign a density to each point of the space, then integrate over the measurable subset of interest. This can be expressed as $\nu (A)=\int _{A}f\,d\mu ,$ where ν is the new measure being defined for any measurable subset A and the function f is the density at a given point.
