#introduction

This is distillation of my knowledge on par with useful videos, papers and articles. Primary goal is to interconnect knowledge from fundamental frameworks as theoretical physics with recent advances in machine learning. I find it useful, because ,arguably, most of the recent papers are done in a way.

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a way of structuring your knowledge. Underlying framework is named [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). Basically trick is that optimal organization information in systematic way using hierarchies and linkages requires to think more about connections between distinct fields. 

It also provide convenient ways of building mindmaps, which connects videos, photos and your notes via objects and groups. I find this structure optimal for building hypothesis.

### Strategy

All knowledge are stored in `Knowledge`folder. It contains  ground-truth blocks for building hypothesis. Every knowledge has brief explanation in note, wiki link, picture and some videos that helped me to build intuition, this will ease your in-depth exploration.

I'll use tags

Specific view for task will be provided in context of hypothesis
